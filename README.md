**Risks:**
1. Scope creep risk - uncontrolled and unauthorized change to the initial intended project scope may lead to the extra cost of additional features, products or functions. 
   Solution: analyze the scope and limit it, notify all stakeholders about what is included in mvp and scope.
2. Skills resource risk - team incompetence in various project divisions is another risk that may contribute to the additional cost of personnel retraining or transfers.
   Solution: take into account the possible lack of experience of the team and allocate the appropriate time in the project plan.
3. Operational risk -  project may stall or terminate if there is a poor implementation of critical operations and core processes.
   Solution: allocate the appropriate time in the project plan for testing.
